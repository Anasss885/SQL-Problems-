Table: Products

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |
| new_price     | int     |
| change_date   | date    |
+---------------+---------+
(product_id, change_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
Each row of this table indicates that the price of some product was changed to a new price at some date.
 

Write a solution to find the prices of all products on 2019-08-16. Assume the price of all products before any change is 10.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| product_id | new_price | change_date |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
| 1          | 20        | 2019-08-14  |
| 2          | 50        | 2019-08-14  |
| 1          | 30        | 2019-08-15  |
| 1          | 35        | 2019-08-16  |
| 2          | 65        | 2019-08-17  |
| 3          | 20        | 2019-08-18  |
+------------+-----------+-------------+
Output: 
+------------+-------+
| product_id | price |
+------------+-------+
| 2          | 50    |
| 1          | 35    |
| 3          | 10    |
+------------+-------+

-- the solution


with CTE as(
    select *,Rank() over(partition by product_id order by change_date desc ) as r
    from Products 
    where change_date<='2019-08-16'
)

select product_id,new_price as price 
from CTE 
where r=1 -- the last update tuple with first rank 

union
select product_id,10 as price 
from Products
where product_id not in (select product_id from CTE )

--
by breaking our solution components the CTE have the code snippet that will print the IDs of people before 16-8 and ranking them Descindingly 
by date to get the last updated one (i.e its rank r must be 1) using RANK() window function .
the main query that will get  product_id,new_price as price from CTE where r=1 as we said why before will also union with 
selecting other Product IDs that have its first change after 16-8 (i.e: so it's deafault price is 10) and it makes very sense that
those IDs is all IDs that NOT belong to CTE at all.
please try hard to understand this problem as it is an Amazon Interview Problem
