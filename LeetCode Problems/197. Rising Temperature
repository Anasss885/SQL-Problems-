Table: Weather

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
 

Write a solution to find all dates' Id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.
-- solution
/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT w1.id as Id 
FROM Weather as w1, Weather as w2
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature
AND DATEDIFF( DAY, w2.recordDate, w1.recordDate) = 1
-- if you want to get difference between dates in the same table you should use self join and also use DATEDIFF function as it gives you diff between
two dates by a specific interval you determine DATEDIFF( Interval, Start date, End date) = difference you want   --

-- another solution

SELECT w2.Id 
FROM Weather w1
INNER JOIN Weather w2 ON DATEDIFF(day, w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate)=1 AND w2.Temperature > w1.Temperature

-- but the first one is more effecient
