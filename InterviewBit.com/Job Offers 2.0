select SUM(Distinct Salary) as Salary from Jobs
join Students on Jobs.Id=Students.Id 
join Departments on Departments.DepartmentId=Students.DepartmentId and DepartmentName='CSE'
order by DepartmentName;



Another Sol:

select sum(distinct(Salary)) as Salary from Jobs
where Id in (select Id from Students where DepartmentId in (select DepartmentId from Departments where DepartmentName ="CSE"))
